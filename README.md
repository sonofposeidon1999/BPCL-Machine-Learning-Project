# BPCL-Machine-Learning-Project
•	Worked on a Machine Learning based project on data provided by the company
•	The project was aimed to predict the amount of steam produced at the CDU-3
•	Took a supervised regression approach to the problem and successfully came up with a well-fitting model using ridge regression to predict the total steam produced given the other parameters given
